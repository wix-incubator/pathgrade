# Pathgrade Grader Authoring

## Procedures

**Step 1: Identify the Grading Strategy**
1. Determine whether the task requires objective verification (deterministic) or qualitative assessment (LLM rubric).
2. For most tasks, combine both: deterministic graders verify outcomes (weight 0.7), LLM rubrics assess approach quality (weight 0.3).

**Step 2: Write a Deterministic Grader**
1. Create a script in the skill's `graders/` directory (bash or TypeScript).
2. The script must output a JSON object to stdout with the following structure:
   ```json
   {"score": 0.67, "details": "2/3 checks passed", "checks": [{"name": "check-name", "passed": true, "message": "Description"}]}
   ```
3. `score` (0.0–1.0) and `details` are required. `checks` is optional but recommended.
4. Read `references/grader-output-schema.md` for the full output specification.
5. Use `awk` for arithmetic in bash scripts — `bc` is not available in `node:20-slim`.
6. Reference the grader in eval.ts:
   ```typescript
   {
     type: 'deterministic',
     run: 'bash graders/check.sh',
     weight: 0.7,
   }
   ```

**Step 3: Write an LLM Rubric Grader**
1. Draft a rubric with explicit scoring criteria and point allocations.
2. Structure the rubric into weighted sections that sum to 1.0:
   ```
   Workflow Compliance (0-0.5):
   - Did the agent follow the mandatory workflow steps?
   Efficiency (0-0.5):
   - Completed in ≤5 commands without trial-and-error?
   ```
3. Reference the rubric in eval.ts:
   ```typescript
   {
     type: 'llm_rubric',
     rubric: '[rubric text or file path]',
     weight: 0.3,
     model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',  // optional, auto-detected from API key
   }
   ```
4. For long rubrics, store in a separate file and reference by path: `rubric: rubrics/quality.md`.

**Step 4: Combine Multiple Graders**
1. Assign weights to each grader based on importance. Weights are normalized automatically.
2. Final reward is calculated as: `Σ (grader_score × weight) / Σ weight`.
3. Example configuration:
   ```typescript
   graders: [
     { type: 'deterministic', run: 'bash graders/check.sh', weight: 0.7 },
     { type: 'llm_rubric', rubric: 'rubrics/quality.md', weight: 0.3 },
   ]
   ```

**Step 5: Validate Graders**
1. Create a reference solution script that produces the expected output.
2. Run `pathgrade --validate` to verify graders score the reference solution correctly.
3. Test only deterministic graders: `pathgrade --grader=deterministic` (skips LLM calls, faster iteration).
4. Test only LLM rubric graders: `pathgrade --grader=llm_rubric`.
5. Run a specific eval with a specific grader type: `pathgrade --eval=my-eval --grader=deterministic`.
6. If a grader returns unexpected scores, inspect the script output and adjust scoring logic.

## Error Handling
* If a deterministic grader outputs non-JSON, ensure all `echo`/`console.log` statements except the final JSON result are redirected to stderr.
* If an LLM rubric grader returns 0.00 with "No API key," set `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment.
* If scores are inconsistent across trials, reduce rubric ambiguity by adding concrete examples of passing and failing behavior.
